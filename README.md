This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card applications using Machine Learning techniques. The dataset contains 690 applications with 16 features including personal, financial, and employment details. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, dropping irrelevant columns, and scaling numeric features. The dataset was split into training (67%) and testing (33%) sets. Several models were trained and evaluated: Logistic Regression (**83.8%**), Decision Tree (**80.3%**), Random Forest (**83.8%**), and XGBoost (**83.8%**), showing that ensemble methods performed best.
